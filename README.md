## Description

The Employee Tracker is a powerful command-line application designed to assist business owners in managing and viewing their company's employee database. Developed using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL, it simplifies the organization of departments, roles, and employees, transforming what can be a complex task into a seamless process. Key features of the tool include the ability to view all departments, roles, and employees in a well-structured table, with detailed information such as department names, job titles, role IDs, salaries, employee names, job titles, and their managers. Additionally, users can add new departments, roles, and employees to the database by entering relevant details, and can easily update an employee's role or manager when necessary.
